## How to use
Well, right after complete installation on a WordPress-/BuddyPress environment, you may either login as an admin or a BuddyPress user. Please see the "blue circle" to the right bottom, which shows the number of registered BuddyPress users. Click this "blue circle" (we call it the "chat trigger"), choose one of the members/friends from the vertical avatars list and start chatting. Even, if your preferred chat partner is not online, she/he will get all your chat messages written to the "BP private message" section, so the message recipient never will miss/loose any of your important messages. You can open more chat windows (sessions) at once.

Right above the white personal chat input field you may find some very nice options, such as
1. "MINI" (drop the current live chat down to the page bottom, but still show the chat partners avatar),
2. "CLOSE" (click and instantly close the respective chat window/you may relaunch the session at any time),
3. "BUSY" (change your avatars border color from "pink"="online/available" to "yellow"="online/busy"),
4. "FILE+" (attach files in the formats either/or .odt, .doc, .pdf, .jpg, .png with a maximum size of 1 MB),
5. "BACK TO PROFILE" (click and close the entire chat, go back to your BuddyPress profile).

Other nice feature: If you have two or more browser windows open and are not active on the web page, which has tomsoc live chat installed, you will get a friendly message tone, if somebody has sent you a chat message, while you are logged-in.
